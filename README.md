# SQL-usertAuthenticationSystem
 
# Hederlige Harrys Bilar ‚Äì Secure SQL Authentication System

This project is a complete, secure **user authentication system** built with **T-SQL** for **Hederlige Harrys Bilar (HHB)**, a fictional car dealership. The system includes user registration, login verification, role management, password recovery, and full security controls such as account lockouts and IP logging.

It follows **industry best practices in SQL database design, security, optimization, and modular procedure-based logic**.

## üîç Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To design and implement a scalable and secure user authentication system that supports:

- Email-based account verification
- Role-based access control (Admin & Customer)
- Secure password storage (SHA-256 + salting)
- Password recovery with token expiration
- Login attempt logging with IP tracking
- Account lockout on failed login attempts
- Views for login reporting and suspicious behavior

## ‚úÖ What I Did

This project demonstrates a full SQL development lifecycle:

### 1. **Database Design**
- Created normalized schema based on authentication best practices
- Designed an ER diagram with primary keys, relationships, and foreign keys
- Created tables:
  - `Users`, `Roles`, `UserRoles`
  - `UserVerification`, `PasswordReset`
  - `LoginAttempts`, `Lockout`

### 2. **Security Implementation**
- Hashed passwords using SHA-256 and unique user-specific salt
- Added support for:
  - Email verification (via tokens)
  - Token expiration for verification and reset links
  - Lockout after 3 failed login attempts within 15 minutes
  - IP-based tracking for login behavior analysis

### 3. **Stored Procedures**
- `RegisterUser`: Handles new account registration and role assignment  
- `VerifyUserEmail`: Activates account via secure email token  
- `TryLogin`: Validates credentials, logs attempts, triggers lockout if needed  
- `ForgotPassword`: Sends password reset token with expiry  
- `SetForgottenPassword`: Validates reset token and updates password  

### 4. **Views & Reports**
- `UserLoginReport`: Summarizes each user's latest login success/failure  
- `LoginAttemptsPerIP`: Tracks login activity per IP using window functions  

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- Added indexes on commonly searched fields: `email`, `user_id`, `attempt_time`  
- Optimized queries using indexed joins and window functions  
- Tested system with real-life login scenarios to validate behavior and response codes

### 6. **Testing**
- Inserted test users with hashed credentials  
- Simulated successful and failed login attempts  
- Verified lockout enforcement  
- Checked login logs and reporting views  
- Manually unlocked test accounts
